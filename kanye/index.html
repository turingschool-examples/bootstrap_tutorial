          <p>
            I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
            Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
            I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
            The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
            I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
            I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
            See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
            And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
            I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
            I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
            What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
            Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that'd be so Kanye
            That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
            And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
          </p>

          <h2>Throne</h2>
          <p>
            [Chorus]
            My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy
            My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy

            [Kanye West - Verse 1]
            They try to tell me my chain broke the levy,
            Maybe cuz its flooded,
            Why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin,
            My teeth already white yall gone make me floss for nothing,
            My teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin',
            While yall got all caps on?,
            Don Cheadle Time,
            Get extra black on em',
            Burn Hollywood burn,
            Take too long for niggas to get their turn,
            Probably be cremated before I get my urn,
            They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids,
            I swear life's a bitch on a period,
            For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx,
            I make my jeweler add a few more links,
            You can look at me and dont fuck what nobody thinks,
            And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks
          </p>

          <h2>Pablo</h2>
          <p>
            My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
            And at this rate we gon' both die broke
            Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt
            And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
            People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter
            My friends best advice was to stay low
            I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
            Especially when you got family members on payroll
            The media said it was outlandish spending
            The media said he's way out of control
            I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending
            I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
            I know I'm the most influential
            That TIME cover was just confirmation
            This generation's closest thing to Einstein
            So don't worry about me, I'm fine
