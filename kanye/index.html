          <h3>Twisted</h3>
          <p>
            Jerry [about Florida]: Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die. Kramer: It's the timeless art of seduction? Jerry: The whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends. If I wanted a long, boring story with no point to it, I've got my life. Elaine: Perhaps, there's more to Newman than meets the eye. Jerry: No. there's less. Jerry: It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. How does my bladder know I'm in a department store.

          <h3>Throne</h3>
          <p>
            George: Was he on his death bed? Jerry: No, he was on his regular bed. Alton: We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There’s nothing funny about that. Jerry: Why would anybody want a friend? Kramer: The woman across the block has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on. Elaine: It's very hard being a stand-up comedian. Sometimes they don't laugh! Jerry: People on dates shouldn’t even be allowed out in public.

            Sidra: And by the way, they're real and they're spectacular. Morty Seinfeld: How could you spend $200 on a tip calculator. Jerry: Six years I've had this t-shirt. It's my best one. I call him... Golden Boy. George: I’m a great quitter. I come from a long line of quitters. I was raised to give up.
