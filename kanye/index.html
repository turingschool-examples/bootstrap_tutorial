      <p> No, they're something nightmares are from. It's getting eerie, what's this cheery singing all about? Actually, I was fired from a fry-cook opportunity. In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children.</div>
      <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Throne</h2>
      <p> Winning over your enemy, the one person guaranteed to reject everything you are, that's real love. Wash, we've got some local color happening. So, are we gonna sing army songs or something? In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 'til it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. I told him that I loved him, I kissed him, and I killed him. What did I say to you about barging into my shuttle?</div>
      <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Pablo</h2>
      <p> You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes! He'll be an empty-headed robot wondering around Hollywood; he'll be fine! Can't even shout, can't even cry. No, Angel, it's not you.</div>
