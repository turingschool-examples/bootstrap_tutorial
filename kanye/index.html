        Kramer: Hey, you know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables. Jerry: Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months! Elaine: I'm not a lesbian. I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian. Elaine: It's very hard being a stand-up comedian. Sometimes they don't laugh. George (excited about the hotel room): Body lotion! Jerry, body lotion.

          George: If it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books. George: My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter, I was raised to give up. It's one of the few things I do well. Jerry: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist, don't you? Newer magazines.

            George: What's so great about a mom and pop store? Let me tell you something, if my mom and pop ran a store I wouldn't shop there. George [about the doll]: Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years. Kenny Bania: Hey, Jerry, did you see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed." Elaine: Snapple? Babu's Brother: No, too fruity. Jerry: Artistic integrity. Where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity? Jerry: Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them.
