        <h2>Seinfeld Rules</h2>
        <p>George: Yeah. I figured since I was lying about my income for a couple of years, I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons. Kramer: Bookman. The library cop’s name is Bookman. That’s like an ice cream man being named Cone! Newman: Jerry, I’m a little offended. Jerry: You’re not a little anything, Newman. Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp? Mr. Peterman: Between you, me, and the lamppost... and the desk, Peggy says this Suse isn't much of a worker.</p>

        <h2>Seinfeld Seriously Rules</h2>
        <p>George: This experience has changed me. It’s made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded. Jerry: Really? George: Sure, why not. George: Do women know about shrinkage? George: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum. Kramer: El Paso. I spent a month there, one night. Newman: Too many people got their mail. Close to 80%. Nobody's ever cracked the 50% barrier. Kramer: I'd like to have shoehorn hands. Latvian orthodox: What aspect of the faith do you find particularly attractive? George: I think the hats. Jerry [to George]: Artistic integrity. Where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity! Kramer: Well, people kept ringing the bell!; George: I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs.</p>

        <h2>No Really, Seinfeld Rules</h2>
        <p>Jerry: You know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex. George: An affair. It's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis and William Holden! Kramer: I don’t know. But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK. George: Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank God that you know me and have access to my dementia? George: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum. , George: The tomato never took on as a hand fruit. Jerry: I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression 'Laughing all the way to the bank'. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. Elaine: I'm not a lesbian. I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian. Lloyd Braun: Serenity now, insanity later. Bob: Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon.</p>
