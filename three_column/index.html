    <h1>Episodes</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Episode 1</h2>
      <p>
        Jerry: But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Babu Bhatt: You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man. Kramer: It's the timeless art of seduction. Newman: It's so great to see a show that's about something. George: If you can't say something bad about a relationship you shouldn't say anything at all. Elaine: There's nothing more sophisticated than diddling the maid and then chewing some gum. Jerry: Poppie's a little sloppy. Jerry: An audit. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. Puddy: I’ll be back. We’ll make out. Jerry: You were in the Army? Kramer: Briefly. Kramer: So I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel, and now I’m driving the bus. Kramer: Well, it all sounds pretty glamourous, but it's business as usual at Kramerica Jerry: Why would anybody want a friend? Jerry (to George): Do your thing there where you lie to everyone!
      </p></div>
      <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Episode 2</h2>
      <p>
        George: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice. But women don't want nice. Jerry: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist, don't you? Newer magazines. Kramer: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!, J. Chiles: So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions. Jerry: Ah well, if it isn't Shakey the Mohel. George: Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank God that you know me and have access to my dementia. Yeah, well, the jerk store called, they're running out of you. Jerry: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby. Jerry: The New York Yankees? George: The New York Yankees! Jerry: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle... Costanza. George: I'd rather be dating the blind. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. Jerry: I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
      </p></div>
      <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Episode 3</h2>
      <p>
        Elaine: I am going to sidle the sidler. Jerry: You sidle? You stomp around like a Clydesdale. George: Who buys an umbrella anyway? You can get them for free at the coffee shop in those metal cans. Jackie: Oh Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding. Jerry: Ah well, if it isn't Shakey the Mohel. George: It must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa.
