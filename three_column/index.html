      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Title 1</h2><p>Jerry [about Florida]: Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die. Kramer: It's the timeless art of seduction? Jerry: The whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends. If I wanted a long, boring story with no point to it, I've got my life. Elaine: Perhaps, there's more to Newman than meets the eye. Jerry: No. there's less. Jerry: It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. How does my bladder know I'm in a department store. Jerry: Do the people that work in those little shops at the airport have any idea what the prices are, everywhere else in the world. Jerry: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist, don't you? Newer magazines. Jerry: It's... not a twist off. George: It’s a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. And I’m not going to dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience. George: I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><h3>Title 2</h3>
        <p>George: Was he on his death bed? Jerry: No, he was on his regular bed. Alton: We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There’s nothing funny about that. Jerry: Why would anybody want a friend? Kramer: The woman across the block has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on. Elaine: It's very hard being a stand-up comedian. Sometimes they don't laugh! Jerry: People on dates shouldn’t even be allowed out in public.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><h4>Title 3</h4>
        <p>Sidra: And by the way, they're real and they're spectacular. Morty Seinfeld: How could you spend $200 on a tip calculator. Jerry: Six years I've had this t-shirt. It's my best one. I call him... Golden Boy. George: I’m a great quitter. I come from a long line of quitters. I was raised to give up.</p></div>
