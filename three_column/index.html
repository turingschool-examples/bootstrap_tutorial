            Do you really want a shower radio? I guess there's no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door. Kramer: I’ve sliced meat so thin, you couldn’t even see it. Jerry: You want me to take an overview? I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview. George: Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel.

            Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel. Friday has a feel. Sunday has a feel. ; Stan the Caddy: Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer. Elaine: He took it out. ; Elaine: Hey Jerry, when do you consider sex has taken place? Jerry: I’d say when the nipple makes its first appearance.

          <h2>Kramer</h2>
          <p>
            Boxers! How do you wear these things? Look at that–they’re bagging up, they’re rising in, and there’s nothing holding me in place! Jerry: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby. Jerry: Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli even if it was deep fried    in chocolate sauce. Jerry: You want me to take an overview? I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview. Fireman: How do you live with yourself? George: It's not easy. Man on beach: Is anyone here a marine biologist? Jerry: I do not like the  bank. I've heard the expression 'Laughing all the way to the bank'. I have never seen anyone actually doing it.
