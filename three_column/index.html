            Yeah, that's a cultural problem is what it is. You know, your average American male is in a perpetual state of adolescence, you know, arrested development. (Hey. That's the name of the show!) Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits.

            I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like aâ€¦she's the belle of the ball! I hear the jury's still out on science. There are dozens of us! Dozens!
