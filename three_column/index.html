          <h2>Title 1</h2>
          <p>Kramer: Here's to feeling good all the time. Jerry: There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character. George: If my parents had a mantle, I might be a completely different person. Jerry: Why do I always have the feeling everyone's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoon. Kramer: Hello… What Delay Industries? Jerry: Why do I always have the feeling everyone's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoon. Jerry: Not a very long trip. Elaine: I'm not a lesbian. I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian. George: Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.</p>

          <h2>Title 2</h2>
          <p>George: Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. Mr. Peterman [in Burma]: So did you have any trouble finding the place. George: Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder. George: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum. Jerry: It, uh, rhymes with a female body part. George: My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it. So, one thing lead to another." Jerry [to George]: Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you. George: Jerry! Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner's in the room. You gotta help me! Jerry: Who is this. Jerry: I don’t return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in. George: Bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents don’t approach strange women. Jerry: Oh, it’s ‘Risk'. It’s a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives?</p>

          <h2>Title 3</h2>
          <p>Jerry: She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs. Kramer: Your Nana’s missing because she’s been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people. George: Jerry! Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner's in the room. You gotta help me! Jerry: Who is this! George: Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder. George: I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest? Jackie Chiles: That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious, outrageous! Jerry: Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs? The Bubble Boy: What are you looking at? You never seen a kid in a bubble before? Jerry: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist, don't you? Newer magazines.</p>
