          <h2>Title 1</h2>
            <p>Done! George: Just remember, it’s not a lie if you believe it. Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? Kramer: People do. I don't. Kramer: El Paso. I spent a month there, one night. Kramer: I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's. George: What, Minelli? Kramer: No. Newman: Just remember, when you control the mail, you control... information. Kramer: That’s right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don’t smell. Jerry: Do the people that work in those little shops at the airport have any idea what the prices are, everywhere else in the world? George: I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love. George: I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. Babu Bhatt: Tell your friends! George: The sea was angry that day, my friends. Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. Kramer: Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Newman: Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money. George: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum. Jerry: Men want the same thing from their underwear that they want from women: a little bit of support, and a little bit of freedom? George: George is getting upset! Kramer: [in the sauna]: It's like a sauna in here.</p>

          <h2>Title 2</h2>
            <p>George: Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me! Bob: Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? Puddy: I painted my face. Elaine: You painted your face? Puddy: Yeah. Elaine: Why? Puddy: Well, you know, support the team?</p>

          <h2>Title 3</h2>
            <p>Kramer: Man's Best Friend... Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone? Jerry : I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, you double your wardrobe. Jerry: There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character? Jerry: Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a flea market, and you think they have fleas there.</p>
